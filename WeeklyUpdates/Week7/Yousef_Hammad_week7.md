## Weekly Individual Project Update Report
### Group number: L2-G6
### Student name: Alizee Drolet
### Week: 7 (February 27 - March 5)
___
1. **How many hours did you spend on the project this week? (0-10)**
   11 hours

2. **Give rough breakdown of hours spent on 1-3 of the following:***
   (meetings, information gathering, design, research, brainstorming, evaluating options, prototyping options, writing/documenting, refactoring, testing, software implementation, hardware implementation)
   1. Top item: Researched and wrote code to detect people, 9h
   2. 2nd item: Design document draft, 2h
   
3. ***What did you accomplish this week?*** _(Be specific)_
  - Downloaded required packages to use tensorflow lite as well as its pretrained AI models
  - Figured out how to use an object detection pretrained model to detect objects (specifically people) to draw a box around the object
  - Triggered another function to capture a 30 second video of the detected person
  - Design document draft (software and hardware components section)

4. ***How do you feel about your progress?*** _(brief, free-form reflection)_
  - Our progress has been up-to-date. I still need to finalize the code and actually implement the circuit to test if it works.
    
5. ***What are you planning to do next week***? _(give specific goals)_
  - Write actual code for the light sensor
  - Write unit tests for the proximity sensor subsystem and the light sensor subsystem
  - Finalize design document
  - Build some of the circuitry
    
6. ***Is anything blocking you that you need from others?*** _(What do you need from whom)_
  - No
